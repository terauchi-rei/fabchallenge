*1st Challenge Feb.15-18**
===============

by [Rei Terauchi](https://terauchi-rei.github.io/mdefweb/) & Emilio Smith

#Group
We formed a group based on the design intervention. Rei and Emilio were workinging on the compost intervention,so we easily came to this idea of making part of our intervention related to making a compost toolkit.
First Jeremy was also in the group, but eventually separated to do the different things after talking about what we want to make for this challenge.
