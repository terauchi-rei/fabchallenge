*1st Challenge Feb.15-18**
===============

by [Rei Terauchi](https://terauchi-rei.github.io/mdefweb/) & Emilio Smith

## Group
We formed a group based on the design intervention. Rei and Emilio were workinging on the compost intervention,so we easily came to this idea of making part of our intervention related to making a compost toolkit.
First Jeremy was also in the group, but eventually separated to do the different things after talking about what we want to make for this challenge.

## Initial Idea
When we started designing, we also had reviews from Guillem, Kate and alumni Pablo for the design intervention and that influenced us to work on this challenge as a prototype for intervention.
Since we talked with them, we wanted to develop a compost toolkit sensor that detects some information about the status of the compost such as temperature, humidity, ph,etc.. We discussed focusing on the one feature now to understand how it can be interactive even without using electric sensors, but in an analog way.  Gillem advised us to use thermochromic paint which can change its color with the temperature to see how warm the compost gets inside the box. Also to show that and what kind of food waste is thrown away is important because it can lead to the consciousness of waste.
